# Thufir Progress (Historical)

Last updated: 2026-02-13

This file is intentionally **historical planning context**.

Authoritative implementation status: `docs/PROGRESS.md`.

## Direction

Thufir Hawat is now a **Hyperliquid-perps-focused** autonomous market discovery + execution system.
It does not rely on prediction markets or predefined event calendars.

Design north-star: `THUFIR_HAWAT_AUTONOMOUS_MARKET_DISCOVERY.md`.

## Design Docs

These docs describe the current conceptual framing and system constraints:

- `THUFIR_HAWAT_AUTONOMOUS_MARKET_DISCOVERY.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `BLACK_SWAN_DETECTOR.md`
- `AGENTIC_THUFIR.md`
- `AGENT_ORCHESTRATION.md`
- `LLM_INFRASTRUCTURE_AND_EXECUTION_CONTROL.md`

## Archived Notes (Prediction Markets)

Earlier planning work referenced prediction markets (Augur/Manifold/CLOB) and "prediction"-oriented UX.
That work is **not** part of the current codebase; keep it as historical context only.

If you need those details, use git history rather than treating the old plan as current.
