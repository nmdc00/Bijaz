# Release v1.4 Latency Checklist (Develop)

## Branch and Scope

- [ ] Base branch is `develop`
- [ ] Feature branch follows `feat/v1.4-latency-*`
- [ ] Branch diff is task-scoped only

## Functional Checks

- [ ] Deterministic expression selection path can run without blocking LLM selection
- [ ] Market-data cache is used by autonomous scan path
- [ ] Event-driven anomaly trigger can invoke immediate scan run
- [ ] Execution trace records quote source + quote age

## Verification Commands

- [ ] `pnpm vitest run tests/unit`
- [ ] `pnpm vitest run tests/integration/v1_4_acceptance.test.ts`
- [ ] `pnpm test`
- [ ] `pnpm build`
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck`
- [ ] `pnpm lint`

## Performance Checks

- [ ] Baseline scan latency report captured (median/P95)
- [ ] Post-change scan latency report captured (median/P95)
- [ ] Improvement meets target thresholds in `release/v1.4-latency-epic.md`

## Release Risks

- [ ] Deterministic selection does not bypass existing risk/policy gates
- [ ] Cache staleness fallback behavior is exercised in tests
- [ ] Trigger dedupe/cooldown prevents scan storms
