# Release v1.6 - Efficiency and Learning Quality

Date: 2026-02-17  
Status: Closed (merged into `develop`)

## Why v1.6

v1.5 made Thufir reliably autonomous. The next bottleneck is operator trust and cycle time:

1. Too much latency from sequential read-only tooling and repeated planning calls.
2. Risk of unnecessary execution-side actions when user intent is analytical.
3. Learning loop still underuses historical outcomes for policy adaptation quality.

v1.6 focuses on doing less redundant work per cycle, responding faster, and improving decision quality through better post-trade attribution.

## v1.6 Core Objective

Increase trading/control-loop efficiency and quality without reducing safety:

1. Reduce p95 decision latency in analysis and autonomous loops.
2. Preserve strict execution safety while preventing accidental action on analysis requests.
3. Upgrade learning loop from journaling-only to policy-relevant closed-trade intelligence.

## Closure Summary

v1.6 scope is implemented and merged into `develop`:

1. Mechanical expression selection in autonomous flow (removed LLM execution gating).
2. Market metadata/mids cache and scan snapshot reuse.
3. Event-driven scan trigger coordinator.
4. Deterministic execution input validation and retry classifier hardening.
5. IOC quote freshness control.
6. Async LLM enrichment (non-blocking).
7. Performance telemetry + acceptance budget evaluator.
