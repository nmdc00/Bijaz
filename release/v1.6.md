# Release v1.6 - Efficiency and Learning Quality

Date: 2026-02-17  
Status: Draft (planning)

## Why v1.6

v1.5 made Thufir reliably autonomous. The next bottleneck is operator trust and cycle time:

1. Too much latency from sequential read-only tooling and repeated planning calls.
2. Risk of unnecessary execution-side actions when user intent is analytical.
3. Learning loop still underuses historical outcomes for policy adaptation quality.

v1.6 focuses on doing less redundant work per cycle, responding faster, and improving decision quality through better post-trade attribution.

## v1.6 Core Objective

Increase trading/control-loop efficiency and quality without reducing safety:

1. Reduce p95 decision latency in analysis and autonomous loops.
2. Preserve strict execution safety while preventing accidental action on analysis requests.
3. Upgrade learning loop from journaling-only to policy-relevant closed-trade intelligence.

## Included Epic

1. Execution Efficiency + Learning Loop Quality Epic  
   See: `release/v1.6-efficiency-learning-loop.md`

## Release-Critical Priorities

1. Parallelize independent read-only tool calls with bounded concurrency and stable ordering.
2. Remove redundant planner/tool inventory calls within a single orchestration cycle.
3. Enforce intent-aware mutating-tool guardrails (analyze/review/explain should not place/cancel orders).
4. Add closed-trade counterfactual metrics and error-type attribution (direction/timing/sizing/exit).
5. Feed recent error distributions into autonomy policy controls (size multiplier, min edge, max trades per scan).
6. Add operator-visible latency and quality diagnostics to `/status` and runtime traces.

## Success Criteria

1. p95 cycle latency decreases by at least 25% vs v1.5 baseline in staging.
2. No regression in trade execution correctness or existing risk gates.
3. Zero mutating-perps actions triggered from analysis-only user prompts in acceptance tests.
4. Every closed trade has deterministic component labels plus counterfactual hold/scale/exit diagnostics.
5. Autonomy policy demonstrates measurable adaptation from recent error mix in simulation fixtures.
6. Test suite + typecheck pass on `develop` with no skipped critical tests.
