# Release v1.6 - Product Direction

Date: 2026-02-17  
Status: Draft (planning)

## Why v1.6

v1.5 focused on autonomy and control loops. v1.6 focuses on efficiency and performance so autonomous behavior stays reliable under real market timing constraints.

## v1.6 Core Objective

Reduce decision-to-execution latency and improve execution reliability without reducing safety controls:

1. Remove unnecessary LLM calls from the execution critical path.
2. Shift market reads to cache/event-driven pipelines instead of sequential polling.
3. Improve order execution quality and reduce invalid retries/noise.
4. Add hard performance budgets with measurable telemetry and regression tests.

## Included Epic

1. Performance and Efficiency Core Epic  
See: `release/v1.6-performance-efficiency-epic.md`

## Release-Critical Priorities

1. Mechanical expression selection in autonomous path (policy engine is the gate; no blocking LLM selection call).
2. Shared `MarketDataCache` with periodic refresh and single-cycle snapshot reuse.
3. Event-driven scan trigger path (news/market anomaly events bypass timer wait).
4. Execution input normalization + validation to stop repeated invalid order attempts.
5. End-to-end performance telemetry and benchmark harness with release budgets.

## Non-Goals (v1.6)

1. No relaxation of risk policy or drawdown protections.
2. No full architecture rewrite of the gateway/agent runtime.
3. No requirement to optimize for ultra-HFT style sub-second trading.

## Success Criteria

1. Autonomous scan path executes with one fewer blocking LLM call in hot path.
2. Scan cycle latency (p50/p95) improves versus v1.5 baseline.
3. API call count per scan cycle is reduced and stable.
4. Order attempt quality improves (lower invalid-input and reduce-only conflict rate).
5. Performance dashboards/log metrics can prove regressions before release promotion.
