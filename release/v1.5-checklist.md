# Release v1.5 Checklist

## Branch and Scope

- [ ] Base branch is `release/v1.5`
- [ ] Feature branch is `feat/v1.5-integration-acceptance-tests`
- [ ] Diff includes only task 11 artifacts (acceptance tests, smoke script, checklist)

## Acceptance Harness

- [ ] Labeling fixture validates direction/timing/sizing/exit tags
- [ ] Regime/stress tags are present on all lifecycle test trades
- [ ] Counterfactual fixture computes deterministic alternate-path PnL
- [ ] Playbook runtime fixture validates continuous policy-safe execution
- [ ] Portfolio basket cap fixture blocks configured breach scenarios

## v1.5 Cross-Feature Checks

- [ ] Derivatives state ingestion is represented in fixture coverage
- [ ] Microstructure feature extraction is represented in deterministic snapshots
- [ ] Cross-venue lead/lag metric path is covered with normalized fixture data
- [ ] Execution telemetry capture and aggregation are covered

## Verification Commands

- [ ] `pnpm vitest run tests/integration/v1_5_acceptance.test.ts`
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck`
- [ ] `./scripts/v1.5-smoke.sh`

## Release Readiness Risks

- [ ] No schema migration drift in labeling/counterfactual/telemetry tables
- [ ] No nondeterministic network dependencies in v1.5 tests
- [ ] Policy reason codes remain explicit for blocked/downweighted actions
