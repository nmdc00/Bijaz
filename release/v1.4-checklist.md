# Release v1.4 Checklist

## Branch and Scope

- [ ] Base branch is `release/v1.4`
- [ ] Feature branch is `feat/v1.4-integration-acceptance-tests`
- [ ] Diff includes only task 10 artifacts (acceptance tests, smoke script, checklist)

## Acceptance Harness

- [ ] `tests/integration/v1_4_acceptance.test.ts` passes
- [ ] Session fixtures are deterministic and cover weekday/weekend boundaries
- [ ] Prediction lifecycle fixture resolves cleanly from open to resolved outcomes
- [ ] Calibration-aware sizing check confirms poor calibration gets smaller suggested size
- [ ] Schema bootstrap verification passes against `src/memory/schema.sql`

## v1.4 Cross-Feature Checks

- [ ] Scheduler control-plane checks are represented in smoke workflow
- [ ] Session context checks are represented in deterministic fixture coverage
- [ ] `/delphi` prediction lifecycle path is covered by resolver + calibration flow tests
- [ ] Calibration-aware risk behavior is covered by decision prompt sizing checks

## Verification Commands

- [ ] `pnpm vitest run tests/integration/v1_4_acceptance.test.ts`
- [ ] `pnpm typecheck`
- [ ] `./scripts/v1.4-smoke.sh`

## Release Readiness Risks

- [ ] No schema migration drift detected in acceptance bootstrap
- [ ] No nondeterministic timestamps or network dependencies in v1.4 tests
- [ ] Follow-up noted for any scheduler-specific E2E checks once scheduler module API stabilizes
