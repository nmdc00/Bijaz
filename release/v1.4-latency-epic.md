# Release v1.4 Latency Extension (Develop)

Date: 2026-02-17  
Base Branch: `develop`  
Status: Planned

## Why This Exists

v1.4 shipped core reliability and calibration improvements. The remaining gap is
hot-path latency during autonomous scans, especially when LLM and sequential
market-data fetches sit in the execution path.

## Objectives

1. Reduce scan-to-execution latency by removing redundant blocking LLM steps.
2. Reduce API round-trips during scans by using shared cached market snapshots.
3. Add event-driven scan triggering on market anomalies to improve reaction time.
4. Improve IOC order pricing inputs with fresher quote state.

## Product Constraints

- Deterministic policy gates remain mandatory before execution.
- LLM remains available for analysis/explanations, but should not block final
  expression selection once policy checks pass.
- Existing v1.4 risk controls, drawdown protections, and calibration-aware policy
  must stay intact.

## Success Metrics

1. Median scan latency drops by at least 30% in local benchmark runs.
2. P95 scan latency drops by at least 40% in local benchmark runs.
3. Expression selection can run with zero blocking LLM calls in deterministic mode.
4. Event-driven trigger path can launch immediate scan runs under anomaly criteria.
5. Existing v1.4 acceptance and regression suites remain green.
